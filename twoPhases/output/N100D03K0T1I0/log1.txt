Optimize a model with 101 rows, 100 columns and 103 nonzeros
Coefficient statistics:
  Matrix range    [1e+00, 1e+00]
  Objective range [4e-02, 1e+00]
  Bounds range    [1e+00, 1e+00]
  RHS range       [1e+00, 1e+00]
Found heuristic solution: objective -0.25
Presolve removed 100 rows and 98 columns
Presolve time: 0.00s
Presolved: 1 rows, 2 columns, 2 nonzeros
